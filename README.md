# lyzr-framework
Lyzr is a cutting-edge agent framework that natively integrates Safe AI and Responsible AI modules within its core architecture. It's the first and only framework designed from the ground up to tackle the challenges of reliability and ethical compliance in AI agents.
# 🚀 Why Lyzr?
# The Challenge
Unreliable Agents: Over 95% of AI agent projects remain proof-of-concepts (POCs) due to issues like hallucinations and inaccurate context retrieval.
Inappropriate Behavior: Agents can exhibit toxicity, bias, and other undesirable behaviors.
Regulatory Hurdles: Industries like finance and insurance face strict regulations that make deploying unreliable AI solutions risky.
# Our Solution
Lyzr reimagines the agent architecture by focusing on data processing before and after large language model (LLM) calls.

This approach ensures:
Enhanced Reliability: Minimizes hallucinations and inaccuracies.
Ethical Compliance: Reduces toxicity and bias.
Regulatory Readiness: Meets strict industry standards for deployment.
