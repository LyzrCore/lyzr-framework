# Lyzr - The Enterprise Agent Framework
Lyzr is an agent framework that natively integrates Safe AI and Responsible AI modules within its core architecture. It's the first and only framework designed from the ground up to tackle the challenges of reliability and safe AI compliance in AI agents.

Over 95% of AI agent projects remain proof-of-concepts (POCs) due to hallucinations, inappropriate agent behavior, and inability to handle complex agentic workflows. Lyzr agent framework solves this with the Safe AI and Responsible AI modules at the core agent architecture layer andthe  Hybridflow Orchestrator at the agentic automation layer.

# Lyzr Agent Architecture
Lyzr reimagines the agent architecture by focusing on data processing before and after large language model (LLM) call within the agent architecture. The first agent framework to natively integrate Safe AI and Responsible AI modules within its core architecture

Native Integration: Safe AI and Responsible AI modules are embedded at the core, not just as add-ons.  
Data Processing Pipeline: Intelligent handling of data inputs and outputs around LLM calls.  
Modular Design: Easily extendable to incorporate new tools and functionalities.  

# üîÑ HybridFlow Orchestration

Lyzr HybridFlow Orchestration allows developers to combine LLM agents with machine learning agents, creating workflows that are both powerful and deterministic.

Reliability: Machine learning agents add predictability to the system.  
Flexibility: Customize workflows to suit complex enterprise needs.  
Scalability: Transition smoothly from POCs to full-scale production.
